# 3) Going Multi-level

# HW: Complete as much of Week 1's assignments as you can + Get comfy with you terminal and running Python files in the terminal
# Reading fo next lecture: Up to "User" assignment in OOP section


# cannot add two datatypes together in python as we could in js
# dictionaries are objects in js

# person = {
#     "first_name": "john", 
#     "last_name": "Smith", 
#     "num_people_saved": 6
# }
# print(person["last_name"]) # Key Notation
# print(person["first_name"], person["last_name"])

# person.last_name #Dot Notation

# all will need the name of the dictionary that you are trying to access and then the name of the item that you are trying to access in the dictionary
